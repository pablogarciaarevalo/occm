summary: The Active IQ page in Cloud Manager shows you any undiscovered ONTAP clusters in your on-premises environment, whether any clusters require updated disk or shelf firmware, and if you are using all the Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses that you were granted when you purchased the on-prem systems. This information is provided to Cloud Manager from Active IQ Digital Advisor.

The Active IQ page in Cloud Manager shows you any undiscovered ONTAP clusters in your on-premises environment, whether any clusters require updated disk or shelf firmware, and if you are using all the Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses that you were granted when you purchased the on-prem systems. This information is provided to Cloud Manager from link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/index.html[Active IQ Digital Advisor^].

== Viewing unused Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses

Many on-premises ONTAP storage system packages that you purchased included a free Cloud Volumes ONTAP license so you can try the NetApp cloud storage offerings in Cloud Manager. You can use the license to create a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance, or you can apply the license to an existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance to expand the capacity by 368 TB.

You can see whether you have any unused Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses based on your NetApp Support Site credentials.

.Steps

. In Cloud Manager, click the *Active IQ* tab.

. Click the *Licenses* tab in the lower portion of the page.
+
image:screenshot_aiq_licenses.png[A screenshot of the used and unused Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses.]
+
A *Use License* button appears for each unused license.
+
. If you want to activate and start using the license, click *Use License*.
+

See the tasks below to learn about the options for using the free license.

== Using unused Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses

You can use unused licenses to create a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance or to extend the capacity of the license on an existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance. The capacity of the license is 368 TB.

The _Expires_ column indicates the last day the license is active. When creating a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP system this is the date the license expires. When updating an existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP system this indicates the length of time the existing license is extended.

The _Description_ column tells you what type of Cloud Volumes ONTAP license it is, for example *PAYGO | Single | Azure*. This sample license includes a "pay-as-you-go" license for a "single node" Cloud Volumes ONTAP system deployed in "Microsoft Azure". The values that can appear in this column are shown in the table.

|===

When creating a _new_ Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, this is the type of system you are deploying. For example, using the sample license (*PAYGO | Single | Azure*), you can create a single-node Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in Azure with 368 TB of space. This license can't be used to create an HA system or to deploy an instance in AWS.

When updating an _existing_ Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, this indicates the type of system that can have the capacity for its existing license extended. Using the sample license again, you can extend the license for any single-node Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in Azure. This license can't be used to extend the license for an HA system or for an instance deployed in AWS.

=== Creating a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP system with the unused license

Follow these steps to create a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance with the unused license.

.Steps

. Click *Use License* and select *Use License for a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.
+
In most cases you will be directed to the *Details & Credentials* page for creating the working environment for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system because both the cloud provider and number of nodes are defined by the license.
+
If you are using a license defined as "All Providers", then you are directed to the *Choose a Location* page so you can pick the cloud provider first, before completing the *Details & Credentials* page.

. Follow the steps to create the working environment and your first volume.
+
See the following sections depending on the cloud provider on which you are deploying the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.
+

* link:task_deploying_otc_aws.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS^]
* link:task_deploying_gcp.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP^]

=== Extending the license term for an existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP system

If you have a currently deployed Cloud Volumes ONTAP system that matches the license requirements of one of the free licenses (meaning the same cloud provider, number of nodes, etc.), you can follow these steps to extend the capacity of the license by 368 TB.

.Steps

. Click *Use License* and select *Add License to existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.
+
image:screenshot_aiq_extend_license.png[A screenshot of the add license dialog for adding a license to an existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.]

. In the "Add License..." page, select the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system where you want to extend the license and click *Add License*.
+
A confirmation dialog is displayed.
+
image:screenshot_aiq_license_added.png[A screenshot showing that the license has been added to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.]

. You can click *Close* to close the window and return to the Active IQ page, or you can click the link to go to the Cloud Volumes ONTAP Licensing page to view more details about licensing for that system.

== Checking for new disk and shelf firmware

You can see whether any of your discovered ONTAP clusters need to have their shelf or disk firmware updated. And you can download the Ansible playbook to upgrade the firmware.

*Note:* The ability to view and download new firmware is available only when you have subscribed to certain support plans.

.Steps

. From the Active IQ page, click the *Firmware Updates* tab.
+
image:screenshot_aiq_firmware.png[A screenshot of the Active IQ page showing nodes that need updated firmware.]
+
A *Download* button appears for the clusters that are not using the recommended firmware.

. Click *Download* for each cluster that needs updated firmware and save the zip file.

. See the following instructions to link:https://aiq.netapp.com/assets/docs/Quick_Reference_Guide.pdf[update your storage system firmware].

.Result

Your firmware is updated. The next time your ONTAP system sends an AutoSupport message to Active IQ, the status in the _Firmware Updates_ page will be updated to show that updates are no longer needed.

== Viewing on-prem workloads that are candidates for the cloud

Certain workloads or volumes are ideal to move to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system from your on-prem ONTAP clusters. Some of the advantages include reduced costs and improved performance and resiliency. The _Cloud-Ready Workloads_ tab provides a list of these workloads from your discovered ONTAP clusters.

The supported workloads that are called out on this page include: SAP, SAP HANA, Oracle, File share, and SharePoint

_Lift and shift_ is an approach for migrating your apps to the cloud. It means moving an application and its associated data to a cloud platform—without redesigning the app. See more information about link:https://www.netapp.com/knowledge-center/what-is-lift-and-shift/[lift and shift^].
