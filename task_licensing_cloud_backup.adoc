summary: As mentioned in the Licensing overview, you can pay for Cloud Backup using a pay-as-you-go subscription through your cloud provider, an annual contract through AWS, or a bring-your-own license from NetApp. If you want to pay as you go or use an annual contract, then you need to subscribe from the marketplace for the cloud provider to which you want to back up data.

As mentioned in the link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html#licensing[Licensing overview], you can pay for Cloud Backup using a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscription through your cloud provider, an annual contract through AWS, or a bring-your-own license (BYOL) from NetApp. If you want to pay as you go or use an annual contract, then you need to subscribe from the marketplace for the cloud provider to which you want to back up data. There’s no need to subscribe from every marketplace.

== Set up a PAYGO subscription

For pay-as-you-go you'll need to pay your cloud provider for object storage costs and NetApp for backup licensing costs. The licensing costs are based on target backup capacity (_before_ ONTAP storage efficiencies). Use these links to subscribe to Cloud Backup from your cloud provider marketplace:

* AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07QX2QLXX[Go to the Cloud Manager Marketplace offering for pricing details^].

* Azure: https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.cloud-manager?tab=Overview[Go to the Cloud Manager Marketplace offering for pricing details^].

* GCP: https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/netapp-cloudmanager/cloud-manager?supportedpurview=project&rif_reserved[Go to the Cloud Manager Marketplace offering for pricing details^].

== Subscribe to yearly contracts through AWS

There are two annual contracts available from the AWS Marketplace:

*	An annual contract that enables you to back up Cloud Volumes ONTAP data and on-premises ONTAP data.
+
Go to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B086PDWSS8[AWS Marketplace page^] to view pricing details.
+
If you want to use this option, set up your subscription from the Marketplace page and then link:task_adding_aws_accounts.html#associating-an-aws-subscription-to-credentials[associate the subscription with your AWS credentials^]. Note that you’ll also need to pay for Cloud Volumes ONTAP using this annual contract subscription since you can assign only one active subscription to your AWS credentials in Cloud Manager.

* A Professional Package that enables you to bundle Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Cloud Backup service by using an annual contract for 1, 2, or 3 years. Payment is per TiB. This option doesn’t enable you to back up on-premises ONTAP data.
+
Go to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-q7dg6zwszplri[AWS Marketplace page^] to view pricing details and go to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap[Cloud Volumes ONTAP Release Notes^] to learn more about this licensing option.
+
If you want to use this option, you can set up the annual contract when you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment and Cloud Manager prompts you to subscribe to the AWS Marketplace.

== Use a Cloud Backup BYOL license

Bring-your-own licenses from NetApp provide 1-, 2-, or 3-year terms. You use the Digital Wallet page in Cloud Manager to manage BYOL licenses for the Cloud Backup service. You can add new licenses and update existing licenses.

=== Obtain your Cloud Backup license file

After you have purchased your Cloud Backup license, you activate the license in Cloud Manager by entering the Cloud Backup serial number and NSS account, or by uploading the NLF license file. The steps below show how to get the NLF license file if you plan to use that method.
