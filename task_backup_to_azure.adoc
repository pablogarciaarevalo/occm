Complete a few steps to get started backing up data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to Azure Blob storage.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Verify support for your configuration

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* You're running Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 or later in Azure.
* You have a valid cloud provider subscription for the storage space where your backups will be located.
* You have subscribed to the https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.cloud-manager?tab=Overview[Cloud Manager Marketplace Backup offering^], or you have purchased link:task_licensing_cloud_backup.html#use-cloud-backup-byol-licenses[and activated^] a Cloud Backup BYOL license from NetApp.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Enable Cloud Backup on your new or existing system

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* New systems: Cloud Backup is enabled by default in the working environment wizard. Be sure to keep the option enabled.

* Existing systems: Select the working environment and click *Enable* next to the Backup & Restore service in the right-panel, and then follow the setup wizard.

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Enter the provider details

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the provider subscription and region, and choose whether you want to create a new resource group or use an already existing resource group. You can also choose your own customer-managed keys for data encryption instead of using the default Microsoft-managed encryption key.

==== image:number4.png[Number 4] Define the backup policy

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The default policy backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies of each volume. Change to hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly backups, or select one of the system-defined policies that provide more options. You can also change the number of backup copies to retain.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
image:screenshot_backup_policy_azure.png[A screenshot that shows the Cloud Backup settings where you can select the backup policy and choose your backup retention]

==== image:number5.png[Number 5] Select the volumes that you want to back up

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Identify which volumes you want to back up in the Select Volumes page.

==== image:number6.png[Number 6] Restore your data, as needed

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Choose to restore an entire backup to a new volume, or to restore individual files from the backup to an existing volume. You can restore data to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in Azure, or to an on-premises ONTAP system.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
See link:task_restore_backups.html[Restoring volume data from backup files^] for details.

== Requirements

Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you start backing up volumes to Azure Blob storage.

The following image shows each component and the connections that you need to prepare between them:

image:diagram_cloud_backup_cvo_azure.png[A diagram showing how Cloud Backup communicates with the volumes on the source systems and the destination storage where the backup files are located.]

When the Cloud Restore virtual machine is deployed in the cloud, it is located in the same subnet as the Connector.

Supported ONTAP versions::
Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 and later.

License requirements::
For Cloud Backup PAYGO licensing, a subscription through the Azure Marketplace is required before you enable Cloud Backup. Billing for Cloud Backup is done through this subscription. link:task_deploying_otc_azure.html[You can subscribe from the Details & Credentials page of the working environment wizard^].
+
For Cloud Backup BYOL licensing, you need the serial number from NetApp that enables you to use the service for the duration and capacity of the license. link:task_licensing_cloud_backup.html#use-cloud-backup-byol-licenses[Learn how to manage your BYOL licenses].
+
And you need to have a Microsoft Azure subscription for the storage space where your backups will be located.

Supported Azure regions::
Cloud Backup is supported in all Azure regions https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[where Cloud Volumes ONTAP is supported^].

Required setup for creating backups in a different Azure subscription::
By default, backups are created using the same subscription as the one used for your Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. If you want to use a different Azure subscription for your backups, you must link:reference_backup_multi_account_azure.html[log in to the Azure portal and link the two subscriptions].

Required information for using customer-managed keys for data encryption::
You can use your own customer-managed keys for data encryption in the activation wizard instead of using the default Microsoft-managed encryption keys. In this case you will need to have the Azure Subscription, Key Vault name, and the Key. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/customer-managed-keys-overview[See how to use your own keys].

Required outbound internet access for Azure deployments::
The Cloud Restore virtual machine requires outbound internet access. If your virtual or physical network uses a proxy server for internet access, ensure that the instance has outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints.

== Enabling Cloud Backup on a new system

Cloud Backup is enabled by default in the working environment wizard. Be sure to keep the option enabled.

See link:task_deploying_otc_azure.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure] for requirements and details for creating your Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

NOTE: If you want to pick the name of the resource group, *disable* Cloud Backup when deploying Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Follow the steps for <<enabling-cloud-backup-on-an-existing-system,enabling Cloud Backup on an existing system>> to enable Cloud Backup and choose the resource group.

.Steps

. Click *Create Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. Select Microsoft Azure as the cloud provider and then choose a single node or HA system.

. In the Define Azure Credentials page, enter the credentials name, client ID, client secret, and directory ID, and click *Continue*.

. Fill out the Details & Credentials page and be sure that an Azure Marketplace subscription is in place, and click *Continue*.

. On the Services page, leave the service enabled and click *Continue*.
+

. Complete the pages in the wizard to deploy the system.

.Result

Cloud Backup is enabled on the system and backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies.

.What's next?

You can link:task_managing_backups.html[start and stop backups for volumes or change the backup schedule^] and you can link:task_restore_backups.html[restore entire volumes or individual files from a backup file^].

== Enabling Cloud Backup on an existing system

Enable Cloud Backup at any time directly from the working environment.

.Steps

. Select the working environment and click *Enable* next to the Backup & Restore service in the right-panel.
+
image:screenshot_backup_cvo_enable.png[A screenshot that shows the Cloud Backup Enable button which is available after you select a working environment.]

. Select the provider details and click *Next*:
.. The Azure subscription used to store the backups. This can be a different subscription than where the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system resides.
+
If you want to use a different Azure subscription for your backups, you must link:reference_backup_multi_account_azure.html[log in to the Azure portal and link the two subscriptions].
.. The region where the backups will be stored. This can be a different region than where the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system resides.
.. The resource group that manages the Blob container - you can create a new resource group or select an existing resource group.
.. Whether you'll use the default Microsoft-managed encryption key or choose your own customer-managed keys to manage encryption of your data. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/customer-managed-keys-overview[See how to use your own keys]).
+
image:screenshot_backup_provider_settings_azure.png[A screenshot that shows the cloud provider details when backing up volumes from a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system to an Azure Blob tier.]

. In the _Define Policy_ page, select the backup schedule and retention value and click *Next*.

* To back up all volumes, check the box in the title row (image:button_backup_all_volumes.png[]).
* To back up individual volumes, check the box for each volume (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[]).

.Result

Cloud Backup starts taking the initial backups of each selected volume and the Backup Dashboard is displayed so you can monitor the state of the backups.
