=== Add purchased licenses to your account

After you purchase licenses for your NetApp account, you need to add the licenses to Cloud Manager so that the capacity is available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.What you'll need

* You need to provide Cloud Manager the serial number of the license or the license file.

* If you want to enter the serial number, you first need to link:task_adding_nss_accounts[add your NetApp Support Site account to Cloud Manager]. This is the NetApp Support Site account that's authorized to access the serial number.

.Steps

. Click *All Services > Digital Wallet > Capacity-Based Licenses*.

. Click *Add License*.

. Enter the serial number for your capacity-based license or upload the license file.
+
If you entered a serial number, you also need to select the NetApp Support Site account that's authorized to access the serial number.

. Click *Add License*.

=== Update a capacity-based license

If you purchased additional capacity or extended the term of your license, then you'll need to update the license in Cloud Manager.

.What you'll need

The license file (or _files_ if you have an HA pair).

.Steps

. Click *All Services > Digital Wallet > Capacity-Based Licenses*.

. Click the action menu next to the license and select *Update License*.

=== Obtain a system license file

In most cases, Cloud Manager can automatically obtain your license file using your NetApp Support Site account. But if it can't, then you'll need to manually upload the license file. If you don't have the license file, you can obtain it from netapp.com.

.Steps

. Go to the https://register.netapp.com/register/getlicensefile[NetApp License File Generator^] and log in using your NetApp Support Site credentials.

. Choose whether you want to receive the serialnumber.NLF JSON file through email or direct download.

=== Update a system license

When you renew a BYOL subscription by contacting a NetApp representative, Cloud Manager automatically obtains the new license from NetApp and installs it on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

If Cloud Manager can't access the license file over the secure internet connection, you can obtain the file yourself and then manually upload the file to Cloud Manager.

. Click *All Services > Digital Wallet > Node-Based Licenses*.

. In the *BYOL* tab, expand the details for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

. Click the action menu next to the system license and select *Update License*.

. Upload the license file (or files if you have an HA pair).

. Click *Update License*.

.Result

Cloud Manager updates the license on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.
