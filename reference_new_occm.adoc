== Cloud Manager 3.9.9 build 2 (18 Aug 2021)

This patch update includes bug fixes.

== Cloud Manager 3.9.9 update (8 Aug 2021)

* <<Application Template enhancements>>
* <<Resource Tagging enhancements>>

=== Application Template enhancements

* Now you can create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment, and your first volume, using templates. This support is provided only for AWS environments at this time, and only for single-node clusters. See how to link:task_define_templates.html#create-a-template-for-a-cloud-volumes-ontap-working-environment[create a template for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment].

* A new feature enables you to add tags to a volume in a volume template. Tagging enables you to group different resources to identify applications, regions, or departments in order to perform automation or to allocate costs to certain departments or regions.

=== Resource Tagging enhancements

Now you can manage tags from your AWS EC2 Instances in Cloud Manager. You can view AWS tags and tag values that have been applied to EC2 Instances, and you can apply those tags to other EC2 Instances that you are managing. link:concept_tagging.html[Learn more about tagging].

== Cloud Manager 3.9.9 (1 Aug 2021)

* <<Cloud Backup enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Sync enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Data Sense enhancements>>
* <<Monitoring enhancement>>
* <<Connector enhancement>>

=== Cloud Backup enhancements

* When configuring backups to Azure Blob from an on-premises ONTAP system, you can define a connection to an Azure Private Endpoint in the activation wizard. This allows you to use a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link.

* An Hourly backup policy is now supported in addition to the existing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly policies. The Hourly backup policy provides a minimal Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

=== Cloud Sync enhancements

* Cloud Sync now enables you to update the data broker with the latest credentials of the source or target in an existing sync relationship.
+
This enhancement can help if your security policies require you to update credentials on a periodic basis. link:task_sync_managing_relationships.html[Learn how to update credentials].
+
image:screenshot_sync_update_credentials.png[A screenshot that shows the Update Credentials option on the Sync Relationships page just under the name of the source or target.]

* When creating a sync relationship, you can now add tags to the object storage target in a sync relationship.
+
Adding tags is supported with Amazon S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, IBM Cloud Object Storage, and StorageGRID.
+
image:screenshot_sync_tags.png[A screenshot that shows the page in the working environment wizard that enables you to add relationship tags to the object storage target in the relationship.]

* Cloud Sync now supports https://www.box.com/home[Box^] as the source in a sync relationship to Amazon S3, StorageGRID, and IBM Cloud Object Storage when using the Cloud Sync API.
+
link:api_sync.html[Learn how to set up a sync relationship using the API].

* When you deploy a data broker in Google Cloud, you can now choose whether to enable or disable a public IP address for the virtual machine instance.
+
link:task_sync_installing_gcp.html[Learn how to deploy a data broker in Google Cloud].

* When you choose the source or target volume for Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Sync now displays a dual-protocol volume no matter which protocol you chose for the sync relationship.

=== Cloud Data Sense enhancements

* Ability to manage file settings for multiple files at a time.
+
In earlier versions of Cloud Data Sense you could perform the following actions on one file at a time: add a status tag, assign a user, and add an AIP label. Now you can select multiple files from the Data Investigation page and perform these actions on multiple files.

* When viewing the Age of Data graph in the Governance dashboard, in addition to viewing data based on the last time it was modified, now you can view the data by when it was created or by when it was last accessed (when it was read).
+
This information is provided in the Data Mapping Report as well.

* When deploying Data Sense on-premises, now you can install scanning software on additional on-prem hosts when you plan to scan configurations that include petabytes of data. These additional _scanner nodes_ provide increased processing power when scanning very large configurations.
+
See how to link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html#multi-host-installation-for-large-configurations[deploy Data Sense software on multiple hosts].

=== Monitoring enhancement

We changed the default name of the Acquisition Unit instance to CloudInsights-AU-_UUID_ so that the name is more descriptive (the UUID is a generated hash).

Cloud Manager deploys this instance when you enable the Monitoring service on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment.

link:concept_monitoring.html[Learn more about the Monitoring service].

=== Connector enhancement

The Connector is now supported on a host that's running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.9.

link:reference_cloud_mgr_reqs.html[View system requirements for the Connector].

== Cloud Manager 3.9.8 build 3 (25 July 2021)

This patch update includes bug fixes and security improvements.

== Cloud Manager 3.9.8 update (13 July 2021)

* <<Application Template enhancements>>
* <<New Resource Tagging feature>>

=== Application Template enhancements

* Support has been added so you can add in the template that you want to link:task_define_templates.html#add-replication-functionality-to-a-volume[replicate the data in the volume you are creating] to another volume using the link:concept_replication.html[Replication service]. When you replicate data to other NetApp storage systems and continually update the secondary data, your data is kept current and remains available whenever you need it.

* Now you can download a report that includes all the volumes that have "drifted" from your template settings instead of just viewing this information for a single volume in the Dashboard. In this manner you can identify these volumes and assign someone to bring the volumes back into compliance. See link:task_check_template_compliance.html#create-a-drift-report-for-non-compliant-resources[how to download your drift report].

=== New Resource Tagging feature

* A new Cloud Manager feature enables you to apply tags to your existing ONTAP resources to help organize and manage those resources. Tags are metadata that you can use to group resources to identify applications, environments, regions, billing codes, cloud providers, and more.
+
link:concept_tagging.html[Learn more about tagging].

== Cloud Manager 3.9.8 (7 July 2021)

* <<Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Backup enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Tiering enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Data Sense enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Sync enhancements>>
* <<Connector enhancement>>
* <<Support Dashboard enhancement>>
* <<Digital Wallet enhancement>>

=== Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements

This release of Cloud Manager includes enhancements to the management of Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

==== Enhancements available in all cloud providers

* New charging methods are available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

** *Capacity-based BYOL*: A capacity-based license enables you to pay for Cloud Volumes ONTAP per TiB of capacity. The license is associated with your NetApp account and enables you to create as multiple Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, as long as enough capacity is available through your license. Capacity-based licensing is available in the form of a package, either _Essentials_ or _Professional_.

** *Freemium offering*: Freemium enables you to use all Cloud Volumes ONTAP features free of charge from NetApp (cloud provider charges still apply). You're limited to 500 GB of allocated capacity per system and there’s no support contract. You can have up to 10 Freemium systems.
+
link:concept_licensing.html[Learn more about these licensing options].
+
Here's an example of the charging methods that you can choose from when deploying a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in Azure:
+
image:screenshot_cvo_charging_methods.png[A screenshot of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment wizard where you can choose a charging method.]

* Write once, read many (WORM) storage is no longer in Preview and is now available for general use with Cloud Volumes ONTAP. link:concept_worm.html[Learn more about WORM storage].

==== Enhancements available in AWS

Starting with the 9.9.1 release, Cloud Volumes ONTAP now supports the m5dn.24xlarge instance type with the following charging methods: PAYGO Premium, bring your own license (BYOL), and Freemium.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/reference_configs_aws_991.html[View supported configurations for Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS^].

==== Enhancements available in Azure

* When creating a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in Azure, you now have the option to select an existing resource group for the VM and its associated resources.
+
image:screenshot_azure_resource_group.png[A screenshot of the Create Working Environment wizard where you can select an existing resource group.]
+
The following permissions enable Cloud Manager to remove Cloud Volumes ONTAP resources from a resource group, in case of deployment failure or deletion:
+
[source,json]
"Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints/delete",
"Microsoft.Compute/availabilitySets/delete",
+
Be sure to provide these permissions to each set of Azure credentials that you've added to Cloud Manager. You can find the latest list of permissions on the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[Cloud Manager policies page^].

* As a security enhancement, Cloud Manager now disables *Blob public access* when creating a storage account for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

* By default, Cloud Manager now enables an Azure Private Link connection on the boot diagnostics storage account for new Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.
+
This means _all_ storage accounts for Cloud Volumes ONTAP will now use a private link.
+
link:task_enabling_private_link.html[Learn more about using an Azure Private Link with Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

==== Enhancements available in Google Cloud

* Starting with the 9.9.1 release, Cloud Volumes ONTAP now supports Balanced persistent disks (pd-balanced).
+
These SSDs balance performance and cost by providing lower IOPS per GB.

* The custom-4-16384 machine type is no longer supported with new Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.
+
If you have an existing system running on this machine type, you can keep using it, but we recommend switching to the n2-standard-4 machine type.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/reference_configs_gcp_991.html[View supported configurations for Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP^].

=== Cloud Backup enhancements

* Cloud Backup now allows you to create backups using a different account/subscription than the one you are using for your Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. You can also create backup files in a different region than the one in which your Cloud Volumes ONTAP system is deployed.
+
This capability is available when using when using AWS or Azure, and only when enabling backup on an existing working environment - it is not available when creating a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment.

* For additional security and control, you can choose your own customer-managed keys for data encryption in the activation wizard instead of using the default Microsoft-managed encryption keys.
+
This is available when configuring backups from an on-premises ONTAP system or from a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in Azure.

* The restriction of restoring only 8 files at a time using single-file restore from your backup files has been removed. Now you can restore up to 100 files at a time.

=== Cloud Tiering enhancements

When tiering data to Azure Blob storage, now your Connector can be running on your premises. You are no longer required to use a Connector installed in an Azure VNet.

=== Cloud Data Sense enhancements

* A new feature enables you to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_managing_highlights.html#moving-source-files-to-an-nfs-share[move any source files that Data Sense is scanning to any NFS share]. This allows you to move sensitive or security-related files to a special area so you can do more analysis.

* You can now choose to quickly map data into categories instead of doing a full classification scan. This enables you to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_generating_compliance_reports.html#data-mapping-report[view the Data Mapping report] from the Governance Dashboard to get an overview of your data when there are certain data sources that you do not need to run a complete scan on.

* Now you can link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_managing_highlights.html#assigning-users-to-manage-certain-files[assign a file to a specific Cloud Manager user] so that person can be responsible for any follow-up actions that need to be done on the file. This capability can be used with the existing feature to add custom Status tags to a file.
+
A new Filter in the Investigation page enables you to easily view all files that have the same person in the "Assigned To" field.

* Some users with smaller scanning requirements have asked to be able to use a smaller Cloud Data Sense instance. Now you can. There are some limitations when using these smaller instances, so link:https://review.docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm_jul_2021_cc/concept_cloud_compliance.html#using-a-smaller-instance-type[see what these restrictions are first].

* Data scans have a negligible impact on your storage systems and on your data. However, if you are concerned with even a very small impact, you can configure Data Sense to perform "slow" scans now.

* The Last Accessed Time value has been added to the File Details page and to reports that you output in CSV format so you can see when users have last accessed the file.

=== Cloud Sync enhancements

* Cloud Sync now supports sync relationships between ONTAP S3 Storage and a Google Cloud Storage bucket from the user interface.
+
link:reference_sync_requirements.html[View supported sync relationships].

* Cloud Sync can now copy object metadata and tags between object-based storage when you create a sync relationship and enable a setting.
+
link:task_sync_creating_relationships.html#settings[Learn more about the Copy for Objects setting].

* You can now set up the data broker to access credentials from an external HashiCorp Vault by authenticating with a Google Cloud service account.
+
link:task_external_vault.html[Learn more about using a HashiCorp Vault with a data broker].

* When setting up a sync relationship to an AWS S3 bucket, the Sync Relationship wizard now enables you to define the tags or metadata that you want to save on the objects in the target S3 bucket.
+
The tagging option was previously part of the sync relationship's settings.

=== Connector enhancement

We redesigned the *Add Connector* wizard to add new options and to make it easier to use. You can now add tags, specify a role (for AWS or Azure), upload a root certificate for a proxy server, view code for Terraform automation, view progress details, and more.

* link:task_creating_connectors_aws.html[Create a Connector in AWS]
* link:task_creating_connectors_azure.html[Create a Connector in Azure]
* link:task_creating_connectors_gcp.html[Create a Connector in GCP]

=== Support Dashboard enhancement

NetApp Support Site (NSS) accounts are now managed from the Support Dashboard, rather than from the Settings menu. This change makes it easier to find and manage all support-related information from a single location.

image:screenshot_nss_management.png[A screenshot of the NSS Management tab in the Support Dashboard where you can add NSS accounts.]

=== Digital Wallet enhancement

The Digital Wallet page is now located in its own tab under the Resources section. link:task_managing_licenses.html[Learn how to manage licenses from your Digital Wallet].

image:screenshot_digital_wallet_menu.png[A screenshot of the Digital Wallet under the All Services option.]

== Cloud Manager 3.9.7 update (7 June 2021)

* <<Cloud Sync support for storage classes in Google Cloud>>
* <<Cloud Tiering enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Backup enhancements>>
* <<Application Templates enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Data Sense (Cloud Compliance) enhancements>>
* <<Global File Cache enhancements>>

=== Cloud Sync support for storage classes in Google Cloud

When a Google Cloud Storage bucket is the target in a sync relationship, you can now choose the storage class that you want to use. Cloud Sync supports the following storage classes:

* Standard
* Nearline
* Coldline
* Archive

=== Cloud Tiering enhancements

* In earlier releases you could transition tiered data from the Standard storage class to another storage class after 30 days when using Amazon S3 or Google Cloud object storage. This release adds some new functionality:

** You can choose the number of days when tiered data will move to a more cost-effective tier. This is called data "life cycle management".
** Azure Blob now supports the _Cool_ access tier.
** Google Cloud Storage supports moving tiered data to multiple storage tiers over time. For example, you can move tiered data from the _Standard_ class to the _Nearline_ class after 45 days, and then to the _Coldline_ class after 75 days, and then to the _Archive_ class after 270 days.

* Now you can proactively move data back to the performance tier from the cloud tier if you want to stop using tiering on a volume, or if you decide to keep all user data on the performance tier, but keep Snapshot copies on the cloud tier. This capability is available when using ONTAP 9.8 and greater.
+
See how to link:task_managing_tiering.html#migrating-data-from-the-cloud-tier-back-to-the-performance-tier[migrate data back to the performance tier].

=== Cloud Backup enhancements

* Two known limitations for backing up data protection (DP) volumes have been resolved. Your systems must have ONTAP 9.8 or greater installed:

** Before, cascaded backup worked only if the SnapMirror relationship type was Mirror-Vault or Vault. Now you can make backups if the relationship type is MirrorAllSnapshots.
** Cloud Backup now can use any label for the backup as long as it is configured in the SnapMirror policy. The restriction of requiring labels with the names daily, weekly, or monthly is gone.

=== Application Templates enhancements

* A new feature enables you to conditionally enable certain actions when the user is running the template.
+
For example, if a Cloud Volumes ONTAP volume is created with NetApp storage efficiency enabled, then Cloud Backup is also enabled on that volume. If storage efficiency is not enabled, then Cloud Backup is not enabled.

* You can now create a volume on an on-premises ONTAP system using templates.

* New functionality called "drift" has been added as an option when creating your templates.
+
This feature enables Cloud Manager to monitor the hard-coded values you entered for a parameter in a template. After a storage admin has created a volume using that template, if Cloud Manager later sees that the parameter value has been changed so that it no longer aligns with the template definition, you can see all the volumes that have "drifted" from the designed template. In this manner you can identify these volumes and make changes to bring them back into compliance.

* Now you can run a template from the Template Dashboard instead of having to open a working environment to launch the template there.

=== Cloud Data Sense (Cloud Compliance) enhancements

* Cloud Compliance has been renamed as *Cloud Data Sense* as of this release. With all the new Governance and other capabilities that have been included in the product, the Compliance name was not promoting the full set of capabilities.

* A new _Full Data Mapping_ report is available from the Governance Dashboard to provide an overview of the data being stored in your corporate data sources to assist you with decisions of migration, back up, security, and compliance processes.
+
The report provides overview pages that summarize all your working environments and data sources, and then provides a breakdown for each working environment. Go link:task_generating_compliance_reports.html#data-mapping-report[here] for more details.

* A new filter in the Data Investigation page enables you to view a list of all files that are duplicated across your storage systems.
+
This is helpful to identify areas where you can save storage space, or identify files that have specific permissions or sensitive information that you do not want duplicated across your storage. link:task_controlling_private_data.html#viewing-all-duplicated-files[See how to viewing all duplicated files].

* You can add a custom Status tags to files that Data Sense is scanning. The Status is not added to the file in the same way as AIP Labels are added. The Status is just seen by Cloud Manager users so you can indicate if a file needs to be deleted, or checked for some reason. link:task_managing_highlights.html#applying-status-tags-to-manage-your-scanned-files[See how to apply and view Status tags in your files].
+
A new Filter in the Investigation page enables you to easily view all files that have a Status assigned.

* Cloud Data Sense can scan for Personal Identifiable Information (PII) in two additional types of files: .DCM and .DICOM.

* The File Size, Created Date, and Last Modified Date values have been added to reports that you output in CSV format. Created Date is also a new filter you can use to narrow down Investigation page search results.

=== Global File Cache enhancements

Global File Cache software version 1.1.0 has been released. A new "Edge Synchronization" feature is available that keeps multiple Edges at a remote office synchronized. When a file is fetched at one Edge, then the same file on all Edges participating in Edge Sync is updated and cached. See the link:concept_gfc.html#whats-new-in-version-1-1-0[new and fixed issues in this release].

== Cloud Manager 3.9.7 (30 May 2021)

* <<Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements>>
* <<Digital Wallet>>

=== Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements

This release of Cloud Manager includes enhancements to the management of Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

==== Enhancements available in AWS

* A new Professional Package enables you to bundle Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Cloud Backup Service by using an annual contract from the AWS Marketplace. Payment is per TiB. This subscription doesn't enable you to back up on-prem data.
+
If you choose this payment option, you can provision up to 2 PB per Cloud Volumes ONTAP system through EBS disks and tiering to S3 object storage (single node or HA).
+
Go to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-q7dg6zwszplri[AWS Marketplace page^] to view pricing details and go to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/reference_configs_aws_991.html[Cloud Volumes ONTAP Release Notes^] to learn more about this licensing option.

* Cloud Manager now adds tags to EBS volumes when it creates a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment. The tags were previously created after Cloud Volumes ONTAP was deployed.
+
This change can help if your organization uses service control policies (SCPs) to manage permissions.

==== Enhancements available in all cloud providers

* If you enabled data tiering on a volume using the _auto_ tiering policy, you can now adjust the minimum cooling period using the API.
+
link:task_tiering.html#changing-the-cooling-period-for-the-auto-tiering-policy[Learn how to adjust the minimum cooling period.]

* When you create a new NFS volume, Cloud Manager now displays custom export policies in ascending order, making it easier for you to find the export policy that you need.

* Cloud Manager now deletes older cloud snapshots of root and boot disks that are created when a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system is deployed and every time its powered down. Only the two most recent snapshots are retained for both the root and boot volumes.
+
This enhancement helps reduce cloud provider costs by removing snapshots that are no longer needed.
+
Note that a Connector requires a new permission to delete Azure snapshots. https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[View the latest Cloud Manager policy for Azure^].
+
[source,json]
"Microsoft.Compute/snapshots/delete"

=== Digital Wallet

A new *Digital Wallet* feature enables you to more easily view and manage your Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses and Cloud Backup licenses from a single location.

link:task_managing_licenses.html[Learn more about Digital Wallet].

image:screenshot_digital_wallet.gif[A screenshot of the Digital Wallet page that shows Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses.]

== Cloud Manager 3.9.6 update (24 May 2021)

Cloud Manager was updated to include the latest version of Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

=== Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.9.1

Cloud Manager can now deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.9.1.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/reference_new_991.html[Learn about the new features included in this release of Cloud Volumes ONTAP^].

== Cloud Manager 3.9.6 build 2 (11 May 2021)

We fixed a bug that caused failures when creating a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment in Azure.

== Cloud Manager 3.9.6 update (5 May 2021)

* <<Cloud Backup enhancements>>
* <<Monitoring enhancements>>
* <<Replication enhancement>>
* <<Account enhancement>>
* <<Cloud Compliance enhancements>>

=== Cloud Backup enhancements

* The separate Backup and Restore Dashboards have been combined under a new *Backup & Restore* tab to make it easier for you to manage all your backup and restore operations from a single location. See link:task_managing_backups.html#viewing-the-volumes-that-are-being-backed-up[the Backup & Restore Dashboard^] for details.

* Now you can create backups from your on-premises ONTAP systems to Google Cloud Storage or to your NetApp StorageGRID systems. See link:task_backup_from_onprem.html[Backing up to Google Cloud Storage^] and link:task_backup_onprem_private_cloud.html[Backing up to StorageGRID^] for details.

* A new feature in ONTAP 9.9.1 enables you to use System Manager to send backups of your on-premises ONTAP volumes to object storage you've set up through Cloud Backup. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/task_cloud_backup_data_using_cbs.html[See how to use System Manager to back up your volumes to the cloud using Cloud Backup.^]

* Backup policies have been improved with the following enhancements:

** Now you create a custom policy that includes a combination of daily, weekly, and monthly backups.
** When you change a backup policy, the change applies to all new backups *and* to all volumes using the original backup policy. In the past the change only applied to new volume backups.

* Some smaller improvements have also been made:

** When configuring the cloud destination for your backup files, now you can select a different region than the region in which the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system resides.
** The number of backup files you can create for a single volume has been increased from 1,019 to 4,000.
** In addition to the earlier ability to delete all backup files for a single volume, now you can delete just a single backup file for a volume, or you can delete all backup files for an entire working environment, if needed.

=== Monitoring enhancements

* You can now enable the Monitoring service on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment even if you have an existing Cloud Insights tenant.

* When you enable the Monitoring service, Cloud Manager sets up a free trial of Cloud Insights. On the 29th day, your plan now automatically transitions from the Trial Version to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/concept_subscribing_to_cloud_insights.html#editions[Basic Edition^].

link:concept_monitoring.html[Learn more about using the Monitoring service with Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

=== Replication enhancement

We redesigned the Replication tab for ease of use and to match the current look and feel of the Cloud Manager user interface.

image:replication.gif[A screenshot of the redesigned Replication tab in Cloud Manager that shows a list of volume relationships.]

=== Account enhancement

The Timeline in Cloud Manager now shows actions and events related to account management. The actions include things like associating users, creating workspaces, and creating Connectors. Checking the Timeline can be helpful if you need to identify who performed a specific action, or if you need to identify the status of an action.

link:task_managing_cloud_central_accounts.html[Learn how to filter the Timeline to the Tenancy service].

=== Cloud Compliance enhancements

* Cloud Compliance has been renamed to “Governance & Compliance”. There are two tabs in Cloud Manager: “Governance” and “Compliance”. The “Governance” tab brings you to the link:task_controlling_governance_data.html#the-governance-dashboard[Governance Dashboard] within the “Governance & Compliance” service, and the “Compliance” tab brings you to the link:task_controlling_private_data.html[Compliance Dashboard].

* Scanning of data stored on Azure Blob is now supported when using the https://min.io/[MinIO service]. See link:task_scanning_object_storage.html[Scanning object storage that uses S3 protocol^] for details.

* New personal data type. Cloud Compliance can now find Austrian SSNs in files.

== Cloud Manager 3.9.6 (2 May 2021)

* <<Cloud Tiering enhancements>>
* <<Application Template enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Sync enhancements>>

=== Cloud Tiering enhancements

* When selecting the volumes that you want to tier from an ONTAP system, now there's a checkbox in the Tier Volumes page to select *all* volumes to make it easier to apply the same policy to all volumes. link:task_managing_tiering.html#tiering-data-from-additional-volumes[See how to select all volumes in the cluster^].

* If you need to change the number of "cooling days" that determine how long data in a volume must remain inactive before it is moved to object storage, now you can specify up to 183 days (up from 63 days) when using ONTAP 9.8 or greater.

=== Application Template enhancements

* The user interface has been enhanced in the AppTemplates service so that it is easier for template designers to move between actions and to see which action they are currently defining.

* Now you can integrate Cloud Compliance when creating a volume template for either Cloud Volumes ONTAP or Azure NetApp Files. So you can enable Compliance for each newly created volume, or enable Cloud Backup for each newly created volume... or create a template that enables both Backup and Compliance on the created volume.

=== Cloud Sync enhancements

* You can now view the errors found in reports and you can delete the last report or all reports.
+
link:task_sync_managing_reports.html[Learn more about creating and viewing reports to tune your configuration].

* A new *Compare by* setting is now available for each sync relationship.
+
This advanced setting enables you to choose whether Cloud Sync should compare certain attributes when determining whether a file or directory has changed and should be synced again.
+
link:task_sync_managing_relationships.html#changing-the-settings-for-a-sync-relationship[Learn more about changing the settings for a sync relationship].

== Cloud Manager 3.9.5 (11 Apr 2021)

* <<Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Sync enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Compliance enhancements>>
* <<New Application Templates feature>>
* <<Connector enhancement>>
* <<Account enhancements>>

=== Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements

This release of Cloud Manager includes enhancements to the management of Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

==== Enhancement available in all cloud providers

Cloud Manager now enables logical space reporting on the initial storage VM that it creates for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

When space is reported logically, ONTAP reports the volume space such that all the physical space saved by the storage efficiency features are also reported as used.

==== Enhancements available in AWS

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP now supports _General Purpose SSD (gp3)_ disks, starting with the 9.7 release. gp3 disks are the lowest-cost SSDs that balance cost and performance for a broad range of workloads.
+
link:task_planning_your_config.html#sizing-your-system-in-aws[Learn more about using gp3 disks with Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP no longer supports Cold HDD (sc1) disks.

==== Enhancement available in Azure

When Cloud Manager creates storage accounts in Azure for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, the TLS version for the storage account is now version 1.2.

=== Cloud Sync enhancements

* The standalone Cloud Sync service has been retired. You should now access Cloud Sync directly from Cloud Manager where all of the same features and functionality are available.
+
After logging in to Cloud Manager, you can switch to the Sync tab at the top and view your relationships, just like before.

* When setting up a sync relationship, you can choose from Google Cloud buckets in different projects, if you provide the required permissions to the data broker's service account.
+
link:task_sync_installing_gcp.html[Learn how to set up the service account].

* Cloud Sync now copies metadata between Google Cloud Storage and S3 providers (AWS S3, StorageGRID, and IBM Cloud Object Storage).

+
image:screenshot_sync_warning.gif[A screenshot that shows a warning when viewing a data broker on the Dashboard.]

=== Cloud Compliance enhancements

* Added support for scanning NFS or CIFS file shares that reside on-premises or in the cloud.
+
Now you can scan file shares that reside on non-NetApp storage systems. See link:task_scanning_file_shares.html[scanning file shares^] for details.

* Added support for scanning object storage that uses the S3 protocol.
+
In addition to scanning Amazon S3 buckets, now you can scan data from any Object Storage service which uses the S3 protocol. This includes NetApp StorageGRID, IBM Cloud Object Store, and more. See link:task_scanning_object_storage.html[scanning object storage^] for details.

* The feature called "Highlights" has been renamed to "Policies". See link:task_managing_highlights.html#controlling-your-data-using-policies[how to use Policies] to help in your compliance and governance efforts.

* Now you can see if there are duplicates of certain files in your storage systems. This is useful to identify areas where you can save storage space. It can also help to ensure that files containing sensitive information are not unnecessarily duplicated in your storage systems.
+
Learn how to link:task_controlling_private_data.html#viewing-whether-files-are-duplicated-in-your-storage-systems[search for duplicate files].

* The link:task_controlling_governance_data.html[Governance dashboard^] has added charts to show link:task_controlling_governance_data.html#top-data-repositories-listed-by-data-sensitivity[top data repositories listed by data sensitivity] and link:task_controlling_governance_data.html#data-listed-by-types-of-open-permissions[data listed by types of Open Permissions].

=== New Application Templates feature

Templates enable you to standardize resource creation in your working environments. For example, you can hard-code required parameters in a "volume template" that are later applied when a storage admin creates a volume. This can include required disk type, size, protocol, cloud provider, and more. You can also turn on certain services, like Cloud Backup, for every created volume.

This makes it easy for your storage admins to create volumes that are optimized for specialized workload requirements; such as databases or streaming services. And it makes life easier for your storage architects knowing that each volume is created optimally for each application. Learn about link:concept_resource_templates.html[Application Templates^] and how you can use them in your environment.

=== Connector enhancement

If you configured a proxy server, you can now enable an option to send API calls directly to Cloud Manager without going through the proxy. This option is supported with Connectors that are running in AWS or in Google Cloud.

link:task_configuring_proxy.html[Learn more about this setting].

=== Account enhancements

* You can now create a service account user.
+
A service account acts as a "user" that can make authorized API calls to Cloud Manager for automation purposes. This makes it easier to manage automation because you don't need to build automation scripts based on a real person's user account who can leave the company at any time. And if you're using federation, you can create a token without generating a refresh token from the cloud.
+
link:task_managing_cloud_central_accounts.html#creating-and-managing-service-accounts[Learn more about using service accounts].

* You can now allow private previews in your account to get access to new NetApp cloud services as they are made available as a preview in Cloud Manager.

* <<General enhancements>>

=== Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements

This release of Cloud Manager introduces the following enhancements for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

==== Support for AWS Outposts

A few months ago, we announced that Cloud Volumes ONTAP had achieved the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Outposts Ready designation. Today, we're pleased to announce that we've validated Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP with AWS Outposts.

If you have an AWS Outpost, you can deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in that Outpost by selecting the Outpost VPC in the Working Environment wizard. The experience is the same as any other VPC that resides in AWS. Note that you will need to first deploy a Connector in your AWS Outpost.

There are a few limitations to point out:

* Only single node Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems are supported at this time
* The EC2 instances that you can use with Cloud Volumes ONTAP are limited to what's available in your Outpost
* Only General Purpose SSDs (gp2) are supported at this time

==== Support for Ultra SSD VNVRAM in all supported Azure regions

Cloud Volumes ONTAP can now use an Ultra SSD as VNVRAM when you use the E32s_v3 VM type with a single node system https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-ultra-ssd[in any supported Azure region^].

VNVRAM provides better write performance.

==== Ability to choose an Availability Zone in Azure

You can now choose the Availability Zone in which you'd like to deploy a single node Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. If you don't select an AZ, Cloud Manager will select one for you.

image:screenshot_azure_az.gif[A screenshot of the Availability Zone drop-down list that's available after choosing a region.]

==== Support for bigger disks and new instances in GCP

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP now supports 64 TB disks in GCP.
+
NOTE: The maximum system capacity with disks alone remains at 256 TB due to GCP limits.

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP now supports the following machine types:
** n2-standard-4 with the Explore license and with BYOL
** n2-standard-8 with the Standard license and with BYOL
** n2-standard-32 with the Premium license and with BYOL

=== Cloud Tiering enhancements

* A new Cloud Performance Test gives you the ability to measure network latency and throughput performance from an ONTAP cluster to an object store before and after setting up data tiering.
+
