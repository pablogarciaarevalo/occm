You can manage backups for Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP systems by changing the backup schedule, enabling/disabling volume backups, creating an on-demand backup, deleting backups, and more.

CAUTION: Do not manage or change backup files directly from your cloud provider environment. This may corrupt the files and will result in an unsupported configuration.

== Viewing the volumes that are being backed up

You can view a list of all the volumes that are currently being backed up in the Backup Dashboard.

.Steps

. Click the *Backup & Restore* tab.

. Click the *Backup* tab and the Backup Dashboard is displayed.

If you are looking for specific volumes in certain working environments, you can refine the list by working environment and volume, or you can use the search filter.

== Changing the schedule and backup retention

The default policy backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies of each volume. You can change to a combination of hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly backups and you can change the number of backup copies to retain. You can also select one of the system-defined policies that provide scheduled backups for 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years.

Changing the backup policy affects both new volumes created after you change the schedule, and any existing volumes that were using the original policy.

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, select *Backup Settings*.

. From the _Backup Settings page_, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the working environment where you want to change the settings and select *Modify Policy*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_modify_policy.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup Settings button which is available after you select a working environment.]

. From the _Modify Policy_ page, change the schedule and backup retention and then click *Save*.
+

== Starting and stopping backups of volumes

You can stop backing up a volume if you do not need backup copies of that volume and you do not want to pay for the cost to store the backups. You can also add a new volume to the backup list if it is not currently being backed up.

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, select *Backup Settings*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_settings_button.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup Settings button which is available after you select a working environment.]

. From the _Backup Settings page_, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the working environment and select *Manage Volumes*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_manage_volumes.png[A screenshot that shows the Manage Volumes button from the Backup Settings page.]

. Select the checkbox for volumes that you want to start backing up, and deselect the checkbox for volumes that you want to stop backing up.
+
image:screenshot_backup_manage_volumes_page.png[The Manage Volumes page where you can select or deselect volumes.]

. Click *Save* to commit your changes.

*Note:* When stopping a volume from being backed up you’ll continue to be charged by your cloud provider for object storage costs for the capacity that the backups use unless you <<Deleting backups,delete the backups>>.

== Creating a manual volume backup at any time

You can create an on-demand backup at any time to capture the current state of the volume. This can be useful if very important changes have been made to a volume and you don't want to wait for the next scheduled backup to protect that data, or if the volume is not currently being backed up and you want to capture its current state.

The backup name includes the timestamp so you can identify your on-demand backup from other scheduled backups.
// A manual backup is always a full backup of the volume. 

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the volume and select *Backup Now*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_now_button.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup Now button which is available after you select a volume.]

The Backup Status column for that volume displays "In Progress" until the backup is created.

== Viewing the list of backups for each volume

You can view the list of all backup files that exist for each volume. This page displays details about the source volume, destination location, and backup details such as last backup taken, the current backup policy, and more.

This page also enables you perform the following tasks:

* Delete all backup files for the volume
* Delete individual backup files for the volume
* Download a backup report for the volume

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the source volume and select *Details & Backup List*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_view_backups_button.png[A screenshot that shows the Details & Backup List button which is available for a single volume.]
+
The list of all backup files is displayed along with details about the source volume, destination location, and backup details.
+
image:screenshot_backup_view_backups.png[A screenshot that shows the List of all backup files for a single volume.]

== Deleting backups

Cloud Backup enables you to delete a single backup file, delete all backups for a volume, or delete all backups of all volumes in a working environment. You might want to delete all backups if you no longer need the backups or if you deleted the source volume and want to remove all backups.

Note that deleting all backups does not disable further backups of this volume or the working environment. If you want to stop creating backups of a volume, you can disable backups <<Starting and stopping backups of volumes,as described here>>. If you want to stop creating backups of all volumes in a working environment, you can deactivate backups <<Disabling Cloud Backup for a working environment,as described here>>.

CAUTION: If you plan to delete a Cloud Volumes ONTAP or on-premises ONTAP system that has backups, you must delete the backups *before* deleting the system. Cloud Backup doesn’t automatically delete backups when you delete a system, and there is no current support in the UI to delete the backups after the system has been deleted. You'll continue to be charged for object storage costs for any remaining backups.
