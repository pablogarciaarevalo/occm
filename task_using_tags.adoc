You can view, add, modify, and delete the tags assigned to your existing resources using the Cloud Manager Tagging service. This allows you to organize and simplify the management of your resources.

== Search for resources that have certain tags

If you want to see all the resources that have a certain tag, or a certain tag and tag key value, you can search for those tags. You can search across all resources, or just within certain resource categories.

.Steps

. Select the *AppTemplate* service and click the *Tags* tab.

. In the _Resource Type_ field, select the resource, for example, *ONTAP:CVO:VOLUME* to search across all Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes.

. In the _Tag Key_ field, select the tag, for example, *Env* to restrict the search to volumes with the "Env" tag.

. In the _Tag Value_ field, select the key value, for example, *production* to restrict the search to volumes with the tag name "Env" and the tag value "production".

If you want to add additional search criteria, follow steps 2 through 5 again and then click *Search*.

=== Search rules

The following rules apply when defining your search:

* After choosing a Resource Type, you can leave the Tag Key field and Tag Value fields empty if you want to list all the resources that have any key and any key value.

* You can choose a single search, or you can define multiple searches to refine the results in the Resource section.

* When defining multiple sets of search criteria:
** If the criteria for two searches are for different resource types, then this is treated as an "OR" operation and the result shows the resources from both searches. For example, the following search returns all Azure NetApp Files volumes that have the "Environment:demo" tag value and all Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes that have the "Environment:demo" tag value.
+

+
** If the criteria for two searches are for the same resource type, then this is treated as an "AND" operation and the result shows only the resources that match *both* searches. For example, the following search returns Azure NetApp Files volumes that have both the "Environment:demo" tag value and "Group:Finance" tag value.
